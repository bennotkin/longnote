# longnote
Terminal function for quick note-taking with date and tags.

To make a minimal note while doing whatever it is you do on your computer, 
- open terminal with spotlight
- type `n "your note" "a tag / keyword"` hit `enter`
- `command + h` to hide terminal

View your longnote by
- opening spotlight and typing longnote; you should be able to read your notes without opening the file, or
- navigate to the file and press `space` to preview file, or
- open the file in a csv viewer, such as excel

## To do
- enable line breaks, quotation marks and other icky characters
- cleanly display previous n notes in terminal
- don't require quote marks
- pick date format
