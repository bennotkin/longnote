# longnote

A wee little applet for making a long running note.

I've been looking for an app that lets me quickly save a note, strictly from my keyboard, with date attached and the possibility of organizing by tags. Often I'm working on one thing and have a thought about another â€“ this function lets me record that thought without worrying about where it goes. Later, I return to the long running note and deal with each entry as necessary.
